        <p><a>The analysis explores the trend and causes of the gender pay gap in the Taiwanese creative industry<b>*</b>.
            The raw data were collected from Taiwan Executive Yuan’s, an open governmental data source.

            I retrieved monthly income and the number of employees from both gender from 1980 to 2021. 
            Through statistical and regression analysis, I demonstrated the relationship between time, salary and
            number of employees in the following charts.</a><br>
            
            <a class="annotation">* Translation in Taiwan as “Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation Industry”</a> 
        </p>

        <p>Overall, the salary for both genders has an upward trend as the year progresses.<a href="#img1">(See Img. 1)</a>
            However, The graph indicates a widening gap between the genders. 
            From 1980 to 2020, male has received 1.7 times more than female in annual income growth.
            There's no siginicant outliers in the data, execpt for a significant downfall in 2021
            <a href="#img2">(See Img 2.)</a>, which is most likely due to the pandemic.

        <p> The chart below is the number of employees from 1980 to 2020. 
            The line chart indicates that number of male workers
            exceeded female workers around 2007, however, this doesn't stop the paygap from increasing.
            This could be that female are paid less or that most of them are in low level or atypical
            positions. </p>

        <p> The heatmap indicates that the <b>number of female employee</b> is correlated to the gender paygap at <b>0.9</b>.
        With high correlation of two variables, linear regression can be used for predeciting future trend of the paygap. </p>
