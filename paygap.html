        <p>According to The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Taiwan has received 6th globally and 1st in Asia in 2019. The index
            showed that Taiwan provides safe healthcare services and plentiful employment opportunities for women. However, in another report
            that based on the Gender Gap Index (GGI), which measures the <b>gender-based gaps</b> through variables such as economic participation
            and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival and etc. Taiwan was ranked 38 out of 156, which nearly <b>fell out of the first
            quartile</b>. The difference in raking indicates that Taiwanese women are receiving less than opportunities compared to men.
        </p>

        <p>In this post, I began with analysing the pay gap in Taiwanese creative arts industry, as it gives the impression of average lower income. I’m
            curious whether women are earning reasonable opportunities and salaries in the industry. Then, I gathered a selection of cultural industries,
            in order to provide a broader view on the topic. </p>

        <h4>THE CREATIVE ARTS INDUSTRIES</h4>
        <p>It is common for people in the creative arts industry to be self-employed, singing up for fixed contract or working part-time. The cultural industry
            consists of project-based jobs that leads to unstable income. Lots of workers, especially young workers, are willing to work for unpaid internships
            or gigs, to increase the chances of being expose to more opportunities. Atypical employments as such result in a large portion of unpaid or poorly
            paid employments in the industry.</p>
        <p>Besides, lack of support from the market and being underfunded from the government, meaning companies and agencies are unable to provide stable revenue.
            According to the statistics <a href="#img1">(See image 1)</a> 
            ,the regular income in the Art and Creative Industry is far less than other professional careers such as publication, television and finance.
            Even with atypical income <a href="#img2">(See image 2)</a>, the creative industry still remains last in comparison with other industries.
        </p>

            <h4>Does Pay gap exist?</h4>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>
                The short answer is yes, and it is increasing.
            </b> 
            In <a href="#img3">Image 3</a>, the graph indicates a widening gap
            between the genders. From 1980 to 2020, the pay gap has increased from 1.03 times to 1.56 times.
            <i><br>
                pay gap = monthly income for men / monthly income for women
            </i>

        </figure>

        <h4>INCOME vs WORK HOURS</h4>
        <p>While some might argue that men devote more time in their career that leads to higher income. However, statistics
            show that the working hours from both genders are actually similar, with daily working hours difference no more
            than <b>± 0.25 hours (15min)</b>. <a href="#img4">(See Image 4)</a> 
            In some of the years, women had worked longer hours than men.
        </p>

            <figcaption>Img. 4 Working Hours Comparison</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h4>INCOME vs NUMBER OF EMPLOYMENT</h4>
        <p>
            It wasn’t until 2007 <a href="#img5">(See Image 5)</a> that the number of women exceeded men, showing that prior 2007,
            women hasn’t been employed as much than the men. That could either be limited opportunities to employment for women,
            or that women had different career choices. For instances, working in other industries or as full-time housewives.
            However, even with more women entering workforces, they are still receiving lesser income.
        </p>

        </figure>


        <h4>OTHER CULTURE INDUSTRIES</h4>

        <p>So far, through the annual statistics, we can see that gender pay gap continues to happen even when more women are in the
            workforce and working same hours as men. </p>

        <p>
            Here, we are going to look at the pay gap from the selected cultural industries in 2020.
            <a href="#img6">Image 6</a> demonstrates the pay gap comparisons amongst publishing, creative arts and advertising and
             marketing and media entertainment. 
        </p>  
            <i>monthly pay gap = monthly income for men - monthly income for women </i><br>
           
            <p>From the chart with can see that in 2020, the design industry has the largest gap up to $NTD 17,500,
                 following second is publishing, with pay gap over $NTD 10,000. 
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img class="imgcenter" id="img6" src="img/payGap/2020_pay_dif.jpg" style="width:150%">
                <figcaption>Img. 5 2020 Pay Gap in the Selected Cultural Industries</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <p>Below is the table of original data:</p>

            <img src="img/payGap/2020_paygap_raw.jpg" style="width:100%">

        <h4>NUMBER OF EMPLOYMENT vs INCOME</h4>

        <p>
            From the graph below <a href="#img8">(Image 8)</a>, we can tell that men dominated most of the industries. 
            Especially in the design industry, in 2020, the gender ratio is <b>84%</b> vs. <b>16%</b>, in the same year, it also held the
            largest pay gap. <a href="#img5">(See Image 5)</a>
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img class="imgcenter" id="img8" src="img/payGap/2020_pri_employment.jpg" style="width:130%">
            <figcaption>Img. 8 2020 Number of Employment Comparison in the Selected Cultural Industries</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            On the other hand, advertising and marketing as the only industry that’s mostly dominated by women, <a href="#img9">(See Image 9)</a>
            with twice of the employment number more than men, they are still receiving lesser wage. This implies that the majority of women could
            be in low-level positions.
        </p>

        <h3>What are the causes?</h3>
        <p>
        It’s difficult to tell from just statistics of the exact causes of pay gap. To understand more about the issue,
        a more detailed description on the data is required. For example, positions, years of experience and ages. 
        If only there are more data provided from the government, there could be more discussion and understanding on this topic.
