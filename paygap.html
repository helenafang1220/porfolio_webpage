        <h4>Understanding the data and background</h4>
        <p> 
            The report aims to explore the gender pay gap in Taiwan’s creative industry. 
            Given its impression on low income, could female be struggling even more in the industry?
        </p>
        <p>
            It is common for people in the creative industry to be self-employed, singing up for fixed contract or working several
            part-time jobs. The creative industry mostly about  task-based or project-based jobs that lead to unstable income.
            Meanwhile, the subjective and varied definition of “creative” does not guarantee a standardised way of becoming
            successful in the industry. This has caused lots of workers, especially young workers, are willing to work for
            unpaid internships or gigs, to increase the chances of being expose to more opportunities. Atypical employments
            as such leads to a large portion of unpaid or poorly paid employments in the industry. 
        </p>

        <p>Besides, current business model in the industry is mostly unable to provide stable revenue, a lot relies or are asking
            more of governmental financial support. According to the statistics <a href="#img1">(See image 1)</a> 
            ,the regular income in the Art and Creative Industry is far less than other professional careers such as publication,
            television and finance. Even with atypical income
                <a href="#img2">
                    (See image 2)</a>, the creative industry still remains last in comparison with other industries.
                </a>

            <h4>Does Pay gap exist?</h4>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>The short answer is yes.</b> In <a href="#img3">Image 3</a>, the graph indicates a widening gap between the genders. 
            From 1980 to 2020, male has received 1.7 times more than female in annual income growth. 
        

            
            In a more detailed data around employment, female tends to work in governmental sector more than men. In the report … As male tends to work in private sectors, that would possibly result in higher income. 
        </p>
        <figure>

            <figcaption>Img. 3 Monthly Salary Since 1980 to 2020</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>While some might argue that male workers devote more time in their career that leads to higher income. 
        However, statistics show that the working hours from both genders are actually similar, with daily working hours
        difference no more than ± 0.25 hours (15min). <a href="#img4">(See Image 4)</a> 
        In some of the years, female workers had worked longer hours than male workers.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
            <a href="#img5">Image 5</a> demonstrates the gap of monthly income in 2020 from different industries within the cultural and 
            creative sector. <br> The graph shows the amount of monthly wages that male workers received more than female workers:<br>  
            <i>( male monthly income - female monthly income ) </i><br>
        </p>
            <p>Sports and Leisure Entertainment has the largest gap up to $NTD 20,000, following the Design industry with a gap over 
            $NTD 17,000 and the third is Publishing, its pay gap is around $NTD 12,000. 
        </p>

        </figure>

        <h4>Income vs Number of Employment</h4>
        <p>
            It wasn’t until 2007 <a href="#img6">(See Image 6)</a> that the number of female workers exceeded male workers, showing that prior 2007,
             female hasn’t been employed as much than the male workers. That could either be limited opportunities to employment
              for female workers, or that female had different career choices. For instances, working in other industries or as
               full-time housewives. However, even with more female entering workforces, they are still receiving less income
                than male. 
        </p>

            <figcaption>Img. 6 Number of Employment Comparison Between Genders</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
        From the graph below <a href="#img7">(Image 7)</a>, over a half of the positions in the Taiwanese Ministry of Culture are occupied by female.
         On the other hand, if look at another statistics in the private sector,<a href="#img8">(Image 8)</a>  male has dominated most of the sectors.
          Especially in the design industry, in 2020, the male:female ratio is <b>84% vs.16%</b>, in the same year, it also holds the
           second largest pay gap which is <b>$NTD 71,202 vs. $NTD 53,411</b>. 
        </p>

        <p> Despite there are significantly more female in the advertising and marketing industry,<a href="#img9">(Image 9) </a> with twice of
            the female workers more than male workers, male are still receiving higher average income. This implies that
            the majority of female workers are be in low-level positions. </p>

        <h3>What are the causes?</h3>
        <p>
        It’s difficult to tell from just statistics of the exact causes of pay gap. To understand more about the issue,
         a more detailed description on the data is required. For example, positions, years of experience and ages.
